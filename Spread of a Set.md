# Spread of a Set
**Measures of spread describe how similar or varied the set of observed values are for a particular variable (data item).**  Measures of spread include: 
- range
- quartiles and the interquartile range
- variance: standard deviation.

## **When can we measure spread?**  
The spread of the values can be measured for quantitative data, as the variables are numeric and can be arranged into a logical order with a low end value and a high end value.

## **Why do we measure spread?**  
Summarizing the dataset can help us understand the data, especially when the dataset is large. 

E.g., the mode, median, and mean summarize the data into a single value that is typical or representative of all the values in the dataset.

Measures of spread summarize the data in a way that shows how scattered the values are and how much they differ from the mean value.
